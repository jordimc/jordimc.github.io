![Magri blog post]({{ "/assets/images/general/black-and-white-man-person-hands-small.jpg" | absolute_url }})

This blog is intented to be a way of sharing with anyone who is interested, mainly, in software development and systems architecture. The blog design is pretty simple (Github and Jekyll FTW) but it keeps the focus on the content which is basically the intention. I could take any pre build theme outside there, but I do like clean and simple designs (hopefully you too).

A short bio: My name is Jordi and I am from Barcelona. I have worked as a Mobile developer, as well a backend developer and at the time of writing this lines I am supposed to be more focused on the Front End development (SPAs), but I am also involved in the archyctecture of the systems. I consider myself a Full stack developer. I have interests in many fields of the Computer Engineering. I have been working for a little more than 6 years in different companies.

To be honest with you this blog is for me. When you want to explain anything to another person, you start digging into details to be sure you are understanding all the details. Is in this moment where, if you don't have a clear idea, you will notice. But of course, hopefully also whatever I write will be useful for any other person.
